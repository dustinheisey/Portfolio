## Objective

My goal was clear: design and develop a website that would not only serve as the central information hub for the Climate Strike in Oregon but also inspire and facilitate collective action against the looming climate crisis.

## Design Approach

- Urgency and Mobilization: I wanted the design to reflect the urgency of the climate crisis. Using bold typography and impactful visuals, I aimed to convey the gravity and immediacy of the strike.
- User-Centric Navigation: Recognizing the diverse audience, from students to workers and concerned citizens, I prioritized clear navigation and easier access to essential information.
- Authentic Imagery: I incorporated compelling images and graphics that resonate with the climate crisis's magnitude and the collective action it demands.

## Development Approach:

- Performance-Driven: Understanding the importance of timely information dissemination, I ensured the website had swift load times and a seamless user experience.
- Accessibility: I designed the site to be universally accessible, catering to users with varied abilities, ensuring everyone could access and engage with the content.
- Responsive Design: Anticipating a significant mobile user base, I optimized the website for all screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience.

## Key Features

- Informative Sections: I integrated comprehensive details about the strike's objectives, the organizations involved, and ways to participate, ensuring visitors were well-informed.
- Engagement Opportunities: The site provides users with multiple avenues to get involved, from volunteering to spreading the word and joining affiliated organizations.
- Resource Hub: Recognizing the need for grassroots mobilization, I dedicated a section to provide resources, including flyers, posters, and social media assets.

## Conclusion

Through a combination of design foresight and strategic development, the platform not only informed but also galvanized action, echoing the urgency of the climate justice movement.
