## Challenge

The software suite by Vernier is globally utilized by educators and students. The challenge lay in crafting interfaces that were intuitive, user-friendly, and catered to a diverse audience with varying technical expertise. The design and development needed to maintain consistency across the different applications while ensuring each software retained its distinct functionality and identity.

## Approach

- Research & Understanding: I initiated the process by comprehending the core functionalities of each software and the unique challenges they posed. Collaborating closely with the software development team and some end-users provided invaluable insights.
- Design System Creation: Leveraging my expertise, I developed a unified design system that would underpin all four applications. This ensured design consistency in elements like buttons, dropdowns, and modals.
- Iterative Design & Development: For each software, the journey began with wireframes, which were then refined into high-fidelity mockups. Using HTML, CSS, and foundational JavaScript, I brought these designs to life. The Lit-Element framework (now known as Lit) was instrumental in this phase.
- Accessibility: Given the educational focus of the software, accessibility was paramount. I ensured that both designs and developments adhered to WCAG guidelines, making the software usable for individuals with disabilities.
- Collaboration: While I was the primary UI developer, more intricate front-end or back-end tasks were handed over to specialized team members. This collaborative approach ensured a seamless transition between design and development phases.

## Outcome

The redesigned and developed interfaces for Video Analysis, Graphical Analysis, Instrumental Analysis, and Spectral Analysis garnered positive feedback from both the Vernier team and their end-users. The unified design system coupled with the intuitive UI and seamless development ensured users could fully leverage each application's capabilities.

## Reflection

This project underscored the synergy between design and development. Collaborating with Vernier, a brand committed to enhancing STEM education, was both challenging and immensely rewarding. It was a reaffirmation of the power of design and development in making complex processes user-friendly and technology accessible to all. The hands-on experience of not only designing but also developing the UI features enriched my understanding of the end-to-end process. Witnessing educators and students benefit from the tools I had a hand in creating was a deeply gratifying experience, reminding me of the tangible impact our work can have on the educational journey of many.
