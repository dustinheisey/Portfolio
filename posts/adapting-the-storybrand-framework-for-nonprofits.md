# Adapting the StoryBrand Framework for Nonprofit Marketing Websites: A Comprehensive Guide

In the realm of marketing, the StoryBrand Framework by Donald Miller has emerged as a powerful tool for businesses. But did you know that this framework is equally effective for nonprofits? This guide will take you through the process of adapting the StoryBrand Framework for nonprofit marketing websites, focusing on the unique needs and dual audiences of nonprofits: the mission and the donors.

## Understanding the Dual Audiences of Nonprofits

Unlike businesses, nonprofits have two primary audiences to consider:

1. **The Mission or Beneficiaries:** These are the individuals, communities, or causes that the nonprofit serves. They are the "heroes" in the nonprofit's story.

2. **The Donors or Volunteers:** These are the individuals or organizations that support the nonprofit through donations or volunteer work. They play the role of the "guides" in the nonprofit's story, providing the resources and support needed for the heroes to achieve their goals.

In the context of the StoryBrand Framework, this means creating two separate narratives or "BrandScripts" â€“ one for each audience.

## Applying the StoryBrand Framework to Nonprofits

Let's delve into how we can apply each element of the StoryBrand Framework to nonprofit marketing websites.

### Character

In the StoryBrand Framework, the character is the hero of the story. For nonprofits, the heroes are the mission or beneficiaries. It's essential to understand what they want and how they want to be perceived in relation to your nonprofit.

### Problem

Every hero faces a problem. For nonprofits, this problem is the issue or cause that the nonprofit is working to address. This problem can be external (the visible issue), internal (the emotional or psychological impact of the issue), or philosophical (why the issue is unjust or wrong).

### Guide

The guide helps the hero overcome their problem. In the case of nonprofits, the donors or volunteers serve as the guides. They provide the resources and support needed for the mission or beneficiaries to overcome their problem.

### Plan

The guide provides a plan to help the hero overcome their problem. For nonprofits, this plan could be the programs or initiatives that the nonprofit has in place to address the issue at hand.

### Call to Action

The call to action is the step that the guide wants the hero to take. For nonprofits, this could be a call for donations, a request for volunteers, or an invitation to an event or program.

### Avoiding Failure

This part of the story outlines what could happen if the hero doesn't take action. For nonprofits, this could be a continuation or worsening of the issue that the nonprofit is working to address.

### Achieving Success

Finally, the story ends with a vision of what success looks like. For nonprofits, this could be a world where the issue has been addressed, the beneficiaries are thriving, or the mission has been achieved.

## Implementing the StoryBrand Framework on Your Nonprofit Website

With a clear understanding of how the StoryBrand Framework applies to nonprofits, you can now implement it on your nonprofit marketing website. Here are some tips to get you started:

- **Understand Your Audiences:** Spend time getting to know both your mission or beneficiaries and your donors or volunteers. Understand their needs, desires, and motivations.

- **Clarify Your Message:** Use the StoryBrand Framework to create clear and compelling narratives for both your audiences. Remember, the clearest message always wins.

- **Show Empathy and Authority:** Show your audiences that you understand their needs and that you have the expertise and resources to meet those needs.

- **Make Your Call to Action Clear:** Whether you're asking for donations, volunteers, or support for a program, make sure your call to action is clear, direct, and compelling.

- **Highlight the Stakes:** Make sure your audiences understand what's at stake if they don't take action. This could be a continuation of the problem you're addressing or a missed opportunity for success.

- **Paint a Picture of Success:** Show your audiences what success looks like. This could be a solution to the problem you're addressing, the achievement of a goal, or the realization of a dream.

## Conclusion

The StoryBrand Framework is a powerful tool for crafting compelling narratives that resonate with your audiences and drive action. By understanding and adapting this framework for your nonprofit marketing website, you can create a stronger connection with your mission or beneficiaries and your donors or volunteers, ultimately leading to greater success for your nonprofit.
